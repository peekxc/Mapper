\usage{
gromov_hausdorff(
  d_X,
  d_Y,
  mu_X,
  mu_Y,
  p = 1,
  flb_solver = "glpk",
  flb_only = TRUE,
  options = list(localsolver = "COBYLA", localtol = 1e-07),
  control = list(maxeval = 300),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{d_X}{either a dist object, or (n x n) numeric metric distance matrix over \code{X}.}

\item{d_Y}{either a dist object, or (m x m) numeric metric distance matrix over \code{Y}.}

\item{mu_X}{(n-length) numeric vector giving the probability measure at each point of \code{X}.}

\item{mu_Y}{(m-length) numeric vector giving the probability measure at each point of \code{Y}.}

\item{p}{The norm to compute.}

\item{flb_solver}{Which LOP ROI plugin solver to use to solve the lower bound approximation.}

\item{flb_only}{If only crude approximation is needed, the lower bound can be returned. See details.}

\item{options}{Options to \code{\link[nloptr]{auglag}}. Ignored if \code{flb_only=TRUE}.}

\item{control}{Control options to pass \code{\link[nloptr]{auglag}}'s control.}

\item{return_optimizer}{Whether to return the optimizer, or just the results.}
}
\value{
If \code{flb_only} is set to TRUE, a list with components:
\itemize{
  \item gh The gromov-wasserstein distance.
  \item mu The result of the optimization.
  \item correspondences A surjective matching from X to Y and from Y to X. 
}
If \code{flb_only} is set to FALSE, a list of both the LOP and QOP optimization results are returned in the 
above format.  

\strong{NOTE:} The quadratic optimization problem (QOP) is non-convex, and requires solving for (n^2 x m^2) variables,
which may be very computationally expensive to run. The FLB is an LOP of the same size.

\description{
This function implements the discrete, extended version of gromov hausdorff distance proposed by 
Memoli in section 7 of (1) for comparing two measure-metric spaces.
}
\details{
This function provides an implementation of the computational objective \emph{(Pp)} listed in Section 7 of (1), which 
calculates an Lp approximition of Gromov-Hausdorff (i.e. wasserstein relaxation) distance between two measure-metric spaces. The first lower bound (FLB)
is first computed via an LOP, and then the solution is used as the initialization point for the corresponding quadratic optimization 
routine. This code utilizes the \emph{R Optimization Infrastructure} (\pkg{ROI}), and relies on having available at least one plugin 
available for to solve the initial lower bound (a linear program). If more than the lower bound is requested, the optimization 
is cast as a generic nonlinear optimization.
